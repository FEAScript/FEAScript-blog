# About FEAScript

[FEAScript](https://feascript.com/) is a lightweight finite element simulation library built in JavaScript. It empowers users to create and execute browser-based simulations for physics and engineering applications without requiring any cloud services.

> ðŸš§ **FEAScript is currently under heavy development.** Functionality and interfaces may change rapidly as new features and enhancements are introduced. ðŸš§

## Project Components

FEAScript consists of several key components:

- **[FEAScript-core](https://github.com/FEAScript/FEAScript-core)**: The core simulation library that provides the finite element analysis capabilities
- **[FEAScript-website](https://feascript.com/)**: The main project website with documentation and resources
- **FEAScript-blog**: This blog where we share updates, tutorials, and insights
